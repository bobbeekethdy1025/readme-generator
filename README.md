## Description
readme-generator is the repository for the 9th challenge assessment that we were given in the bootcamp.

Above this text you will find two links that will take you to the repository that was created to store the codes and files for this challenge. The latter link will send you to the webpage that host the gif on display.

Within the repository you will find all the files that were necessary to create this Readme generator.
In order to run the generator, you need to run 'Node index.js' in the terminal.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
